## Project Description

My project will be a game where you control a spacecraft through the vast darkness of space.  Your goal is to make it as far as you can while avoiding space debris and collecting fuel to make sure your spacecraft can fly.  Your score will accumulate with each fuel can you collect, and the highest score will be saved in a leaderboard shown to the player.
